# Cati

CATI (Converter Apk To Image) is a project implemented by Christian Peluso, student of Information Technology in Pesche 
(IS).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing 
purposes.

1. Use the command git clone in your system 

2. Create a virtual environment with Python, then activate the environment and install the dependencies reported in the 
requirements file.
   1. Windows
    ```    
        source venv/script/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```
   2. Linux
    ```    
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

3. Install [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install) and follow the install instructions to set up 
appropriately.

4. Use the script `install.sh` to set up the current path to the project itself.

5. Move your apk files in the folder "sample", be sure to put the apks in folders named after their macro-type/classes, like this:

```
tree /cati/sample/
|-- type1
|   |-- application.apk
|   |-- application2.apk
|   `-- application3.apk
|-- type2
|   |-- app.apk
|   |-- app2.apk
|   `-- app3.apk
`-- type3
    |-- soft.apk
    |-- soft2.apk
    `-- soft3.apk
```

6. Once there you can run `python apk_decompiler.py` to extract the smali files.

7. Finally, you can run `python main_cati.py` that will convert the smali files in OPCode and then convert them in 
PNGs.

### Dependencies

The project needs Python3 to be run, it has been tested in Windows 10, Ubuntu and Manjaro KDE.

#### External tools required for vectorization:

- [GIST DESCRIPTOR](https://github.com/tuttieee/lear-gist-python)
- [APKTOOL](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool)

#### Usage

The datasets can be created with the main_cati.py script:

See further information on the arguments required with:

```
python main_cati.py --help
usage: main_cati.py [-h] [-o DATASET_NAME] [-t TRAINING] [-v VALIDATION] [-i IMAGE_SIZE] [-b BATCH_SIZE] 
                    [-i IMAGE_SIZE][--no_storage] [--no_results]
               
  -t TRAINING, --training TRAINING
                        Percentage of data to be saved in training, insert a number between 10 to 90
  -v VALIDATION, --validation VALIDATION
                        Percentage of data to be saved in validation, insert a number between 10 to 90
  -i IMAGE_SIZE, --image_size IMAGE_SIZE
                        FORMAT ACCEPTED = SxC , the Size (SIZExSIZE) and Channel of the images in input default is 
                        [250x1] (reshape will be applied)
  -o OUTPUT_NAME, --output_name OUTPUT_NAME
                        Enter the name by which you want to call the output
  --no_storage          Do not create a dataset in tami/DATASETS
  --no_results          Do nothing in results folder, so no creation of legends or images of the smali files in
                        cati/results
```
